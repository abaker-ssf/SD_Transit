OBJECTID,OID,Internal feature number.
SHAPE,Geometry,Feature geometry.
stop_id,String,"The stop_id field contains an ID that uniquely identifies a stop or station for the agency. Multiple routes may use the same stop. The stop_id is dataset unique (by agency).Note that because this layer is a combination of datasets from two agencies the ""stop_id"" field may not be unique unless combined with the ""stop_agency"" field.  Use the ""stop_UID"" field for unique stop identifiers."
stop_name,String,The stop_name field contains the name of a stop or station. It is intended to be a name that people will understand in the local and tourist vernacular.
stop_lat,Double,The stop_lat field contains the latitude of a stop or station. The field value must be a valid WGS 84 latitude
stop_lon,Double,The stop_lon field contains the longitude of a stop or station. The field value must be a valid WGS 84 longitude value from -180 to 180.
stop_code,String,"The stop_code field contains short text or a number that uniquely identifies the stop for passengers. Stop codes are often used in phone-based transit information systems or printed on stop signage to make it easier for riders to get a stop schedule or real-time arrival information for a particular stop.The stop_code field should only be used for stop codes that are displayed to passengers. For internal codes, use stop_id. This field should be left blank for stops without a code."
stop_place,String,Common name of location of stop as defined by the tranist agency
location_type,Integer,"The location_type field identifies whether this stop ID represents a stop or station. If no location type is specified, or the location_type is blank, stop IDs are treated as stops. Stations may have different properties from stops when they are represented on a map or used in trip planning.The location type field can have the following values:0  or blank - Stop. A location where passengers board or disembark from a transit vehicle. 1 - Station. A physical structure or area that contains one or more stop. "
parent_station,String,"For stops that are physically located inside stations, the parent_station field identifies the station associated with the stop. To use this field, stops.txt must also contain a row where this stop ID is assigned location type=1.isIf this stop ID represents: A stop located inside a station. And this entry's location type is: 0 or blank. Then this entry's parent_station field contains:  The stop ID of the station where this stop is located. The stop referenced by parent_station must have location_type=1. If this stop ID represents: A stop located outside a station. And this entry's location type is: 0 or blank  Then this entry's parent_station field contains:  A blank value. The parent_station field doesn't apply to this stop.  If this stop ID represents: A station. And this entry's location type is: 1 Then this entry's parent_station field contains:  A blank value. Stations can't contain other stations. "
wheelchair_boarding,Integer,"The wheelchair_boarding field identifies whether wheelchair boardings are possible from the specified stop or station. The field can have the following values:0 (or empty) - indicates that there is no accessibility information for the stop1 - indicates that at least some vehicles at this stop can be boarded by a rider in a wheelchair2 - wheelchair boarding is not possible at this stopWhen a stop is part of a larger station complex, as indicated by a stop with a parent_station value, the stop's wheelchair_boarding field has the following additional semantics:0 (or empty) - the stop will inherit its wheelchair_boarding value from the parent station, if specified in the parent1 - there exists some accessible path from outside the station to the specific stop / platform2 - there exists no accessible path from outside the station to the specific stop / platform"
intersection_code,String,Intersection code defined by the transit agency
stop_agency,String,Value assigned by SanGIS to identify the agency that services the stop. MTS = San Diego Metropolitan Transit SystemNCTD = North County Transit District
stop_UID,String,"Unique stop identifier created by SanGIS.  The stop_UID is a calculated value combining the ""stop_agency"" filed and the ""stop_id"" field separated by an underscore character (e.g. MTS_10088)."
