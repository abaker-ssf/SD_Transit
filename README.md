#San Deigo Transit Analysis
Investigator: Alexander Baker

Overview:
This is an Attempt to understand the San Diego County public mass transit situation. I aim to achieve this understanding 
through conducting a statical and data analysis of the situation with local government provided data. From these analysis
I am hoping to learn more about data science and the public transit situation of my home city. 

Current Experiment:
Try to map the San Diego County Transit system. In order to do this i need to explore the data and wrangle with it. Once
the data is mapped try to have the routes mapped out.


Todo list:
1. Conduct an assessment of the current data i have collected.
2. I have no fucking clue.
