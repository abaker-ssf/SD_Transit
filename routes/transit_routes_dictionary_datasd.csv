OBJECTID,OID,Internal feature number.
SHAPE,Geometry,Feature geometry.
shape_id,String,Shape identifier created by ArcGIS processing tool
route_id,String,"The route_id field contains an ID that uniquely identifies a route. The route_id is dataset unique.Note that because this layer is a combination of two agency datasets, route_id may not be unique unless combined with the agency_id field"
agency_id,String,The agency_id field defines an agency for the specified route. This value is referenced from the agency.txt file. MTS = San Diego Metrolpolitan Transit SystemNCTD = North County Transit District
route_desc,String,"The route_desc field contains a description of a route which may provide useful, quality information."
route_type,SmallInteger,"The route_type field describes the type of transportation used on a route. Valid values for this field are:0 - Tram, Streetcar, Light rail. Any light rail or street level system within a metropolitan area (includes Trolley)1 - Subway, Metro. Any underground rail system within a metropolitan area. 2 - Rail. Used for intercity or long-distance travel. 3 - Bus. Used for short- and long-distance bus routes. 4 - Ferry. Used for short- and long-distance boat service. 5 - Cable car. Used for street-level cable cars where the cable runs beneath the car. 6 - Gondola, Suspended cable car. Typically used for aerial cable cars where the car is suspended from the cable. 7 - Funicular. Any rail system designed for steep inclines. "
route_url,String,The route_url field contains the URL of a web page about that particular route. This should be different from the agency_url.
RouteShapeName,String,Route Shape Name created by by the ArcGIS  processing tool.
route_short_name,String,"The route_short_name contains the short name of a route. This will often be a short, abstract identifier like ""32"", ""100X"", or ""Green"" that riders use to identify a route, but which doesn't give any indication of what places the route serves. At least one of route_short_name or route_long_name must be specified, or potentially both if appropriate. "
route_long_name,String,"The route_long_name contains the full name of a route. This name is generally more descriptive than the route_short_name and will often include the route's destination or stop. At least one of route_short_name or route_long_name must be specified, or potentially both if appropriate."
route_type_text,String,Route Type Text - text value for Route Type.  Created by the ArcGIS tool used to create the routes layer.
route_color,String,"In systems that have colors assigned to routes, the route_color field defines a color that corresponds to a route. The color is provided as a six-character hexadecimal number, for example, 00FFFF. If no color is specified, the default route color is white (FFFFFF)."
route_color_RGB,String,Route Color RGB value.  Created by the ArcGIS tool used to develop the GIS layer. Hexadecimal format route color converted to a RGB triplet that can more easily be used as reference when choosing symbology in ArcMap
route_text_color,String,"The route_text_color field can be used to specify a legible color to use for text drawn against a background of route_color. The color is provided as a six-character hexadecimal number, for example, FFD700. If no color is specified, the default text color is black (000000)."
route_text_color_RGB,String,Route Text Color RGB value.  Created by the ArcGIS tool used to develop the GIS layer. Hexadecimal format route color converted to a RGB triplet that can more easily be used as reference when choosing symbology in ArcMap
